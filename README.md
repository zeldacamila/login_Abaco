# SIR ABACO APP

This is an user interface designed for Abaco workers to login to use an app based on the email.

I used:
- React with a Vite template (npm create vite@latest)                                                   
- Vercel to deploy the web page
- Google OAuth 2.0 (@leecheuk/react-google-login, gapi-script)











React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
